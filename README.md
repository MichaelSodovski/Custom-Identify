# Custom-Identify

## Brief Description
The Custom Identify Widget is an innovative tool designed for Experience Builder apps that enhances user interaction with map layers. Upon clicking a map feature, the widget reveals detailed information pulled from an associated SDE attribute table, allowing users to gain insights into the feature's attributes. It boasts a dual-tab interface for efficient data management and visualization.

The first tab presents a carousel-style UI that elegantly displays attribute fields, accommodating scenarios where multiple features overlap within a specified buffer zone. Users can browse through these features with ease, and a dedicated button provides the convenience of zooming to any selected feature on the map.

The second tab offers a dynamic menu with file management capabilities. Users can upload attachments directly to a feature or remove them as needed. The interface lists folders and files linked to the feature, reflecting a clear structure of associated documents. Additionally, users have the option to create new folders, which, along with the files, are stored on the server where the API resides. This system not only organizes attachments in a user-friendly manner but also constructs the corresponding physical directories on the host drive, streamlining the data management process.
